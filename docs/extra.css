/* --- Modern Typography Setup --- */

/* 1. RELAX THE BODY TEXT 
   1.7 is a "luxury" line-height that makes long text much easier to read.
   1.125rem (18px) is a modern standard size (up from default 16px). */
body {
  line-height: 1.4;
  font-size: 1.125rem; 
}

/* 2. FIX HEADING SPACING (The "Vertical Rhythm")
   We add lots of space ABOVE headings to visually separate sections,
   and a bit more space BELOW to let the title breathe. */
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-weight: 600;     /* Semi-bold looks cleaner than full bold */
  line-height: 1.3;     /* Headings shouldn't have huge line heights */
}

/* Exception: No massive gap at the very top of the page */
h1:first-of-type, main > h2:first-of-type {
  margin-top: 0;
}

/* 3. LIST BREATHING ROOM 
   Default lists are too tight. This spaces out bullet points. */
li {
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
}

/* 4. CODE BLOCKS
   Give code blocks more space so they don't crash into text. */
pre, .sourceCode {
  margin-top: 1.5em;
  margin-bottom: 1.5em;
