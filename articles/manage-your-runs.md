# Manage your Runs

``` r
library(formr)
# Automatically finds your stored keys
formr_api_authenticate(host = "https://api.formr.org") # or your custom URL!
```

While the `formr_api_push_project` and `formr_api_pull_project`
functions are excellent for managing file-based assets (surveys, CSS,
images), sometimes you need direct control over the run’s configuration
on the server.

The `formr` package provides a suite of lower-level functions to create,
configure, inspect, and delete runs programmatically.

## Listing Your Runs

To see an overview of all studies you have access to, use
[`formr_api_runs()`](http://rubenarslan.github.io/formr/reference/formr_api_runs.md).
This returns a tidy data frame containing the run ID, name, and status
flags (whether it is public, locked, or has active cron jobs).

``` r
# List all runs and their status
runs <- formr_api_runs()

# Quickly check which runs are currently active/public
subset(runs, public == TRUE)
```

## Creating a New Run

You can create a new, empty run directly from R. This is useful if you
are setting up a battery of studies programmatically.

``` r
# Create a new run named "pilot-study-v1"
formr_api_create_run("pilot-study-v1")
```

The function returns the public link to your new run upon success.

## Configuring Run Settings

Once a run exists, you often need to toggle its settings—for example,
locking it to prevent accidental edits during data collection or making
it public for participants.

The
[`formr_api_run_settings()`](http://rubenarslan.github.io/formr/reference/formr_api_run_settings.md)
function handles this.

- **GET:** If you provide only the run name, it returns the current
  settings.

- **PATCH:** If you provide a `settings` list, it updates the run.

``` r
# 1. View current settings
settings <- formr_api_run_settings("pilot-study-v1")

# 2. Update settings: Lock the run and make it public
formr_api_run_settings("pilot-study-v1", settings = list(
  locked = TRUE,     # Prevent structure changes
  public = 2,      # Allow participants to access via Link
  expiresOn = "2026-12-31" 
  # Set Data Expiration Date (required to make your Run public)
))
```

## Managing Run Structure (JSON)

The “Structure” of a run is the ordered list of units (surveys, emails,
pauses, jumps) that determines the participant’s path. You can export
this structure to JSON for safekeeping or import it to replicate a study
design.

### Exporting Structure

You can inspect the structure as an R list or save it directly to a JSON
file to create a 1:1 backup of the runs configuration.

``` r
# Inspect structure in R
struct <- formr_api_run_structure("pilot-study-v1")
print(struct)

# Save to file (Backup)
formr_api_run_structure("pilot-study-v1", file = "pilot_v1_structure.json")
```

### Importing Structure

You can upload a JSON file to replace the current run structure. This is
useful for creating templates: you can define a complex flow once and
apply it to multiple runs. If they are part of your JSON file, this will
also create the necessary surveys for the run.

``` r
# Overwrite the run's structure with a local JSON file
formr_api_run_structure("pilot-study-v1", structure_json_path = "pilot_v1_structure.json")
```

## Deleting a Run

You can permanently delete a run if it was created by mistake or is no
longer needed.

**Warning:** This will remove everything associated with the run,
including the structure, attached files, and all collected results.
However, the surveys used in the run will be kept.

``` r
# Delete a run (prompts for confirmation by default)
formr_api_delete_run("pilot-study-v1")

# Force delete without confirmation (for automated scripts)
formr_api_delete_run("pilot-study-v1", prompt = FALSE)
```
