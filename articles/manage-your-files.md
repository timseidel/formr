# Manage your Files

``` r
library(formr)
# Automatically finds your stored keys
formr_api_authenticate(host = "https://api.formr.org") # or your custom URL!
```

Most complex studies require more than just survey spreadsheets. For
example, you might need to host images for experimental stimuli.

While the [Project
Workflow](http://rubenarslan.github.io/formr/articles/manage-your-studies.md)
(`formr_api_push_project`) syncs your `files/` folder automatically, the
functions below give you direct, granular control over the file storage
of your run.

## Listing Files

To see what files are currently attached to your run, use
[`formr_api_files()`](http://rubenarslan.github.io/formr/reference/formr_api_files.md).
This returns a data frame containing the file names, their public URLs,
and upload timestamps.

``` r
# List all files attached to the study
files <- formr_api_files("my-study-name")

# View the first few files
head(files)
```

The returned `url` column is particularly useful if you need to embed
these assets in external emails or websites.

## Uploading Files

You can upload files individually or in bulk. This is useful for quickly
patching a missing image or adding a new stimulus without re-syncing the
entire project.

### Single File

``` r
# Upload a single logo
formr_api_upload_file("my-study-name", path = "assets/logo.png")
```

### Multiple Files or Directories

The function is flexible: you can pass a vector of paths or a directory.
If you pass a directory, `formr` will upload all files directly inside
it.

``` r
# Upload multiple specific files
formr_api_upload_file("my-study-name", path = c("assets/img1.jpg", "assets/img2.jpg"))

# Upload an entire folder of stimuli
formr_api_upload_file("my-study-name", path = "assets/stimuli/")
```

## Deleting Files

To keep your run clean, you can remove obsolete files.

``` r
# Delete a specific file
formr_api_delete_file("my-study-name", file_name = "old_logo.png")

# Delete a list of files
formr_api_delete_file("my-study-name", file_name = c("test1.jpg", "test2.jpg"))
```

### Cleaning Up (Delete All)

If you are restructuring your study and want to start fresh, you can
wipe all files. **Use this with caution.**

``` r
# Delete ALL files (prompts for confirmation)
formr_api_delete_all_files("my-study-name")
```
