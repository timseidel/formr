## The accompanying R package for the study framework [formr](https://github.com/rubenarslan/formr.org) 

The formr R package serves as a bridge between the formr.org survey framework and your R environment. While the package is pre-loaded on the server to handle survey logic, it also provides a suite of tools for your local R workflow.

When used locally (External Usage): These functions streamline the administration and analysis of your study.

- Data Management: Connect to the API to fetch, type-cast, and automatically score results in a single step.
- Project Syncing: Download your study structure (surveys, CSS, assets) to your computer for local editing and version control, then push changes back to the server.

When used within a run (Internal Usage): These functions are designed to run inside formr.org via OpenCPU to enhance the participant experience.

- Dynamic Feedback: Generate immediate, personalized charts and visualizations to show participants their results.
- Survey Logic: Use shorthand functions to handle complex text logic or conditional display settings within your survey units.
