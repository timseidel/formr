Package: formr
Title: formr survey framework accompanying R package
Description: Serves as a robust companion toolkit for the 'formr' survey 
    framework. The package acts as a bridge between the server and 
    a local R environment. Key features include an API interface 
    for fetching, type-casting, and automatically scoring data, as well as 
    a project management workflow for syncing study assets (surveys, CSS) 
    for local editing. It also supplies functions for use within 'formr' 
    runs to generate dynamic, personalized feedback plots and simplify 
    survey logic.
